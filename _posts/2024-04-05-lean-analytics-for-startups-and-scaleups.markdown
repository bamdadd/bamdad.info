## Introduction

After helping 50+ startups implement data-driven cultures, we've seen firsthand how lean analytics can be the difference between burning cash and building sustainable growth. This guide shares our framework for implementing lean analytics at different stages of company growth.

## The Lean Analytics Cycle

```
Measure → Learn → Build → Measure
         ↓       ↓       ↓
      Insights  Product  Metrics
```

## Stage 1: Problem/Solution Fit (Pre-Seed to Seed)

### Key Metrics to Track

#### 1. Qualitative Metrics (Primary Focus)
- **Customer Interview Insights**: Pain point validation score
- **Problem Urgency**: How badly users need a solution (1-10 scale)
- **Current Solution Satisfaction**: NPS of existing alternatives
- **Willingness to Pay**: Price sensitivity analysis

#### 2. Early Quantitative Signals
```python
# Example: Calculating Problem-Solution Fit Score
def calculate_ps_fit_score(interviews):
    scores = {
        'problem_validated': 0,
        'solution_excitement': 0,
        'willingness_to_pay': 0
    }
    
    for interview in interviews:
        if interview['confirms_problem']:
            scores['problem_validated'] += 1
        if interview['excitement_level'] >= 8:
            scores['solution_excitement'] += 1
        if interview['would_pay_today']:
            scores['willingness_to_pay'] += 1
    
    # PS Fit Score = weighted average
    ps_fit = (
        scores['problem_validated'] * 0.4 +
        scores['solution_excitement'] * 0.3 +
        scores['willingness_to_pay'] * 0.3
    ) / len(interviews)
    
    return ps_fit  # Target: > 0.7
```

### Analytics Stack for Early Stage
- **Google Analytics 4**: Basic user behavior
- **Hotjar/FullStory**: Session recordings for UX insights
- **Typeform/Tally**: Customer feedback collection
- **Airtable/Notion**: Lightweight CRM and metrics tracking
- **Cost**: < $100/month

## Stage 2: Product/Market Fit (Seed to Series A)

### The One Metric That Matters (OMTM)

Different business models require different OMTMs:

| Business Model | OMTM | Target Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| B2B SaaS | Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) | 20% MoM growth |
| Marketplace | Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) | 30% MoM growth |
| Consumer App | Daily Active Users (DAU) | 5% WoW growth |
| E-commerce | Revenue Per Visitor (RPV) | 10% MoM improvement |

### Implementing Cohort Analysis

```sql
-- Example: Revenue cohort analysis for SaaS
WITH cohort_items AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', u.created_at) as cohort_month,
    u.user_id,
    DATE_PART('month', AGE(p.payment_date, u.created_at)) as month_number,
    p.amount
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN payments p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
),
cohort_size AS (
  SELECT 
    cohort_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as num_users
  FROM cohort_items
  GROUP BY cohort_month
),
cohort_revenue AS (
  SELECT
    cohort_month,
    month_number,
    SUM(amount) as revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as retained_users
  FROM cohort_items
  GROUP BY cohort_month, month_number
)
SELECT 
  c.cohort_month,
  c.month_number,
  cs.num_users as cohort_size,
  c.revenue,
  c.retained_users,
  ROUND(100.0 * c.retained_users / cs.num_users, 2) as retention_rate,
  ROUND(c.revenue / cs.num_users, 2) as revenue_per_user
FROM cohort_revenue c
JOIN cohort_size cs ON c.cohort_month = cs.cohort_month
ORDER BY c.cohort_month, c.month_number;
```

### Key Metrics Dashboard

#### North Star Metric Framework
1. **Define North Star**: The one metric that best captures core value delivery
2. **Input Metrics**: 3-5 metrics that directly influence North Star
3. **Counter Metrics**: 2-3 metrics to prevent gaming the system

Example for B2B SaaS:
- **North Star**: Weekly Active Teams (not just users)
- **Input Metrics**:
  - New team signups
  - Team activation rate (≥3 members active)
  - Feature adoption rate
- **Counter Metrics**:
  - Churn rate
  - Support ticket volume
  - Performance degradation

## Stage 3: Scale-up (Series A to Series C)

### Advanced Analytics Implementation

#### 1. Predictive Analytics
```python
# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction Model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import pandas as pd

def predict_ltv(customer_features):
    """
    Predict customer LTV based on early behavior signals
    """
    features = [
        'first_week_actions',
        'initial_purchase_value',
        'referral_source_quality',
        'engagement_score',
        'support_tickets_filed',
        'feature_adoption_rate'
    ]
    
    # Train model on historical data
    model = RandomForestRegressor(
        n_estimators=100,
        max_depth=10,
        min_samples_split=20
    )
    
    # Feature importance for business insights
    feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
        'feature': features,
        'importance': model.feature_importances_
    }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
    
    return model.predict(customer_features), feature_importance
```

#### 2. Experimentation Framework

```python
# A/B Testing Statistical Significance Calculator
import scipy.stats as stats

def calculate_test_significance(control, treatment, confidence=0.95):
    """
    Determine if treatment significantly outperforms control
    """
    # Calculate conversion rates
    control_rate = control['conversions'] / control['visitors']
    treatment_rate = treatment['conversions'] / treatment['visitors']
    
    # Pooled probability
    pooled_prob = (control['conversions'] + treatment['conversions']) / \
                  (control['visitors'] + treatment['visitors'])
    
    # Standard error
    se = (pooled_prob * (1 - pooled_prob) * 
          (1/control['visitors'] + 1/treatment['visitors'])) ** 0.5
    
    # Z-score
    z_score = (treatment_rate - control_rate) / se
    
    # P-value
    p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.norm.cdf(abs(z_score)))
    
    # Minimum detectable effect
    mde = 2.8 * se  # For 80% power at 95% confidence
    
    return {
        'significant': p_value < (1 - confidence),
        'p_value': p_value,
        'lift': (treatment_rate - control_rate) / control_rate,
        'mde': mde,
        'sample_size_needed': calculate_sample_size(mde, control_rate)
    }
```

### Data Infrastructure for Scale

#### Modern Data Stack
```sql
-- Example dbt model for customer health score
-- models/analytics/customer_health_score.sql

-- dbt configuration would go here (config block)
-- materialized='table' with indexes on customer_id, health_score, churn_risk

WITH usage_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_TRUNC('day', event_time)) as active_days_30d,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users_30d,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'key_feature_used' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as key_actions_30d
    FROM events_table
    WHERE event_time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
support_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as tickets_30d,
        AVG(resolution_hours) as avg_resolution_time,
        AVG(satisfaction_score) as avg_satisfaction
    FROM support_tickets_table
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
billing_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        mrr,
        months_since_signup,
        total_revenue_to_date,
        CASE 
            WHEN payment_failed_attempts > 0 THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END as payment_issues
    FROM billing_summary_table
)
SELECT
    b.customer_id,
    COALESCE(u.active_days_30d, 0) as active_days_30d,
    COALESCE(u.active_users_30d, 0) as active_users_30d,
    COALESCE(u.key_actions_30d, 0) as key_actions_30d,
    COALESCE(s.tickets_30d, 0) as support_tickets_30d,
    COALESCE(s.avg_satisfaction, 5) as support_satisfaction,
    b.mrr,
    b.months_since_signup,
    
    -- Calculate health score (0-100)
    LEAST(100, GREATEST(0,
        (u.active_days_30d / 30.0 * 25) +  -- 25 points for daily usage
        (LEAST(u.active_users_30d / 10, 1) * 25) +  -- 25 points for team adoption
        (CASE WHEN s.tickets_30d < 3 THEN 25 ELSE 10 END) +  -- 25 points for low support need
        (s.avg_satisfaction / 5.0 * 25)  -- 25 points for satisfaction
    )) as health_score,
    
    -- Churn risk categorization
    CASE
        WHEN u.active_days_30d < 5 AND b.months_since_signup > 1 THEN 'HIGH'
        WHEN u.active_days_30d < 15 OR s.avg_satisfaction < 3 THEN 'MEDIUM'
        ELSE 'LOW'
    END as churn_risk
    
FROM billing_metrics b
LEFT JOIN usage_metrics u ON b.customer_id = u.customer_id
LEFT JOIN support_metrics s ON b.customer_id = s.customer_id
```

## Stage 4: Optimization (Series C+)

### Machine Learning for Growth

#### 1. Personalization Engine
- **Recommendation Systems**: Collaborative filtering for content/product recommendations
- **Dynamic Pricing**: ML-driven price optimization
- **Churn Prediction**: Proactive intervention for at-risk customers
- **Lead Scoring**: Prioritize sales efforts on high-probability conversions

#### 2. Automated Insights
```python
# Anomaly detection for metric monitoring
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

def detect_metric_anomalies(metric_data, sensitivity=0.95):
    """
    Detect anomalies in business metrics using Prophet
    """
    # Prepare data for Prophet
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'ds': metric_data['date'],
        'y': metric_data['value']
    })
    
    # Build model
    model = Prophet(
        interval_width=sensitivity,
        daily_seasonality=True,
        weekly_seasonality=True
    )
    model.fit(df)
    
    # Make predictions
    forecast = model.predict(df)
    
    # Identify anomalies
    anomalies = df[
        (df['y'] < forecast['yhat_lower']) | 
        (df['y'] > forecast['yhat_upper'])
    ]
    
    # Calculate severity
    anomalies['severity'] = abs(
        anomalies['y'] - forecast.loc[anomalies.index, 'yhat']
    ) / forecast.loc[anomalies.index, 'yhat']
    
    return anomalies[anomalies['severity'] > 0.2]  # 20% deviation threshold
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Vanity Metrics Trap
**Problem**: Tracking metrics that look good but don't drive business value
**Solution**: Always tie metrics to revenue, retention, or user value

### 2. Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Endless data analysis without action
**Solution**: Set decision thresholds before analysis

### 3. Over-instrumentation
**Problem**: Tracking everything, understanding nothing
**Solution**: Start with 5-7 key metrics, expand gradually

### 4. Ignoring Qualitative Data
**Problem**: Numbers without context lead to wrong decisions
**Solution**: Combine quantitative metrics with user interviews

### 5. Statistical Insignificance
**Problem**: Making decisions on insufficient data
**Solution**: Use statistical significance calculators and set minimum sample sizes

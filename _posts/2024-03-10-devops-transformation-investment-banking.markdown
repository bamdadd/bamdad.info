## Overview

This case study details our 18-month DevOps transformation journey with a tier-1 investment bank, moving from legacy mainframe systems to a cloud-native architecture while maintaining regulatory compliance and zero trading downtime.

## The Challenge

Our client faced significant technical debt:
- **30-year-old COBOL trading systems** processing $2B daily
- **6-month release cycles** hampering innovation
- **72-hour deployment windows** with frequent rollbacks
- **Siloed teams** with minimal collaboration
- **Manual compliance reporting** taking weeks

## Transformation Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (Months 1-3)

#### Current State Analysis
- Mapped 200+ applications and their dependencies
- Identified 50+ manual processes suitable for automation
- Assessed team skills and training requirements
- Evaluated regulatory constraints (MiFID II, Dodd-Frank, Basel III)

#### Target Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Cloud-Native Platform           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Kubernetes    │   Service Mesh         │
│  (Multi-Region)│   (Istio)              │
├────────────────┴────────────────────────┤
│         Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure      │
│  AWS (Primary)  │  On-Premise (Legacy)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 2: Foundation Building (Months 4-9)

#### Infrastructure as Code
Implemented GitOps workflow with Terraform:
```hcl
module "trading_cluster" {
  source = "./modules/eks-cluster"
  
  cluster_name    = "trading-prod-eks"
  cluster_version = "1.28"
  
  node_groups = {
    critical = {
      instance_types = ["c5.24xlarge"]
      min_size       = 10
      max_size       = 50
      desired_size   = 20
      
      labels = {
        workload = "trading-engine"
        tier     = "critical"
      }
    }
  }
  
  encryption_config = {
    provider_key_arn = aws_kms_key.cluster.arn
    resources        = ["secrets"]
  }
}
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
- **Source Control**: GitLab with branch protection rules
- **Build**: Jenkins with distributed agents
- **Artifact Repository**: JFrog Artifactory
- **Security Scanning**: Checkmarx + Aqua Security
- **Deployment**: ArgoCD for Kubernetes deployments

### Phase 3: Migration Execution (Months 10-15)

#### Strangler Fig Pattern
Gradually replaced legacy components:
1. Built API facades around COBOL systems
2. Implemented new microservices behind feature flags
3. Gradually shifted traffic using canary deployments
4. Decommissioned legacy code after validation

#### Key Microservices Developed
- **Order Management Service**: 100k orders/second capacity
- **Risk Calculation Engine**: Real-time VAR calculations
- **Market Data Processor**: Sub-millisecond latency
- **Regulatory Reporting Service**: Automated MiFID II reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Container Strategy

#### Base Image Hardening
```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.18 AS base
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    ca-certificates \
    && adduser -D -u 10001 appuser

FROM scratch
COPY --from=base /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
COPY --from=base /etc/passwd /etc/passwd
COPY app /app
USER appuser
ENTRYPOINT ["/app"]
```

### Observability Stack

#### Metrics & Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: 500+ custom metrics per service
- **Grafana**: 50+ dashboards for different stakeholders
- **Alert Manager**: 200+ alert rules with PagerDuty integration

#### Distributed Tracing
- **Jaeger**: End-to-end transaction tracing
- **Correlation IDs**: Tracking across all systems
- **Performance Baselines**: Automated anomaly detection

### Security Implementation

#### Zero Trust Architecture
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: trading-service-policy
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: trading-service
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals: ["cluster.local/ns/production/sa/order-service"]
    to:
    - operation:
        methods: ["POST"]
        paths: ["/api/v1/orders/*"]
  - from:
    - source:
        principals: ["cluster.local/ns/production/sa/risk-service"]
    to:
    - operation:
        methods: ["GET"]
        paths: ["/api/v1/positions/*"]
```

#### Secrets Management
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Centralized secrets storage
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Database credentials rotated hourly
- **Encryption**: Client-side encryption for sensitive data

## Automation Achievements

### Automated Testing Framework
```python
# Example: Trading system integration test
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_order_execution_flow():
    # Setup
    order = create_test_order(
        symbol="AAPL",
        quantity=1000,
        order_type="LIMIT",
        price=150.00
    )
    
    # Execute
    response = trading_api.submit_order(order)
    
    # Verify
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["status"] == "PENDING"
    
    # Verify downstream systems
    assert risk_service.check_margin(order.id).sufficient
    assert compliance_service.check_regulations(order.id).compliant
    assert settlement_service.get_status(order.id) == "READY"
```

### Deployment Automation
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime releases
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Based on SLO violations
- **Database Migrations**: Flyway with backward compatibility
- **Configuration Management**: Helm charts with environment overlays

## Compliance & Governance

### Regulatory Compliance Automation
- **Automated audit trails**: Every change tracked in Git
- **Compliance as Code**: Policy enforcement via OPA
- **Automated reporting**: Daily regulatory reports
- **Change approval workflow**: JIRA + ServiceNow integration

### Risk Management
```yaml
# Example: Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy
package deployment.risk

deny[msg] {
  input.kind == "Deployment"
  input.metadata.labels.tier == "critical"
  input.spec.replicas < 3
  msg := "Critical services must have at least 3 replicas"
}

deny[msg] {
  input.kind == "Deployment"
  not input.spec.template.spec.securityContext.runAsNonRoot
  msg := "Containers must run as non-root user"
}
